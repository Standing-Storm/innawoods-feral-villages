# Innawoods Feral Villages
Just a simple mod that adds a few scattered villages of people to Innawoods. They're human but there's something a little off about them.

They have Stone Age technology so unless you have a naked and afraid start and manage to lure one away and bash in their head with a rock, it shouldn't disrupt the tech tree at all.
