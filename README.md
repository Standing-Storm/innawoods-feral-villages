# Innawood Feral Villages
Just a simple mod that adds a few scattered villages of people to Innawood. They're human but there's something a little...off about them.

This is mostly for color, for people who want to have other humans around but not disrupt normal Innawood play. They have Stone Age technology so unless you have a naked and afraid start and manage to lure one away and bash in their head with a rock, it shouldn't disrupt the tech tree at all.
